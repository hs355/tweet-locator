## Tweet Locator by Topic or Search Terms ##




### Description ###

This script shows the location of tweets (geographical location from where Twitter users submitted tweets) that relate to specific topics or search terms. In the 'terms' list enter a selection of terms or topics that are of interest. Allow the script to collect sufficient data by changing the end_time variable (a minimum of one hour may be necessary, depending on volume of tweets at a given time). Either a heat map or a point map can be generated. 

In Examples 1 and 2 below, tweets relating to the 'Super Tuesday'  and 'Mini Super Tuesday' Democratic primaries were collected. Data collection took place on March 3 and March 10 (that is, on Super Tuesday and Mini Super Tuesday, respectively) to see if heightened Twitter activity relating to the primaries is detected in states with primaries. 

Example 3 displays locations in London where Twitter users express desire for coffee or cafes together with Starbucks locations. This could help cafes in decisions on where to open new locations.
